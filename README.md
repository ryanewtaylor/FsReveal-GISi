# FsReveal-GISi

FsReveal-GISi is a fork of [FsReveal] that applies the GISi theme to the generated slides.

[FsReveal] allows you to write beautiful slides in [Markdown] and brings F# to the [reveal.js][revealjs] web presentation framework.

The GISi theme was created by @cbupp via [gisi-revealjs](https://github.com/gisinc/gisi-revealjs)

# Getting Started

1. Edit `slides/index.md` in your text editor using [FsReveal's Markdown](http://fsprojects.github.io/FsReveal/formatting.html) format.
1. Open a command prompt and run `build.cmd` (on windows) or `build.sh` (on Linux or OSX).
1. A web server will be started and your slides built and open in your browser.
1. Edit `slides/index.md` to rebuild your slides and refresh your browser to see the changes.
