# FsReveal-GISi

FsReveal-GISi is a fork of [FsReveal] that applies the GISi theme to the generated slides.

[FsReveal] allows you to write beautiful slides in [Markdown] and brings F# to the [reveal.js][revealjs] web presentation framework.

The GISi theme was created by @cbupp via [gisi-revealjs](https://github.com/gisinc/gisi-revealjs)
